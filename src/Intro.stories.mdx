Welcome to the Beam Design System!

Beam is built to primarily serve the [Homebound](https://www.homebound.com) internal application ecosystem.

## How to use

Beam's storybook serves three purposes:

1. **[Catalog](?path=/story/catalog-browsing-the-catalog--page)** - For consumers to browser and view available components and learn how to use them.
2. **[Design QA](?path=/story/design-qa-how-to-qa--page)** An area for the Design team to view and approve the implementation of the patterns
3. **[Workspace](?path=/story/workspace-working-in-beam--page)** - A place for engineers to build and prototype new components and test edge cases.

_**Note:** This Storybook is in the midst of a reorganization. For the time being, most of what you are looking for will be located in the Workspace folder._
