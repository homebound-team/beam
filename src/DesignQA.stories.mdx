# <img src="/BeamIcon.png" alt="drawing" width="30" /> Design QA

The goal of this section is to provide Beam's design team an area where they can compare the implementation to the pattern defined in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/aWUE4pPeUTgrYZ4vaTYZQU/%E2%9C%A8Beam-Design-System).

The stories are be organized in a similar fashion to the Figma's Pages. The individual stories should represent a Figma board as best as possible. Some Figma boards have much more content than is reasonable to show in a single Story. When that is the case, then multiple stories will be required to contain all the content within a single Figma board.
