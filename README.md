# ðŸªµ Beam Design System

Homebound's React component design system.

_To see the latest designs, check out the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/aWUE4pPeUTgrYZ4vaTYZQU/%E2%9C%A8Beam-Design-System-Refresh?node-id=0%3A1) file._

## Getting Started

There are a few ways to run the application each with its own advantage.

```bash
# Only when running for the first time to install dependencies for Beam & Truss
> yarn
> cd ./truss && npm i # Note that this will change director to /truss

# Easiest way to start.
# This runs Storybook and Truss/Beam automatic build process
> yarn start

# Alternatively Beam/Truss automatic build process can be started independently from storybook by using two terminals.
> yarn watch
> yarn storybook

# Lastly, the following three commands can be used to achieve the same result.
# This makes the console output easier to read
> yarn watch:beam
> yarn watch:truss # Only required if any ./truss/*.ts files will be altered
> yarn storybook
```

## Commands

### `> yarn watch:beam`

Builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

### `> yarn storybook`

This loads the stories from `./stories`.

> NOTE: Stories should reference the components as if using the library, similar to the example playground. This means importing from the root project directory. This has been aliased in the tsconfig and the storybook webpack config as a helper.

## Configuration

Code quality is set up for you with `prettier`, `husky`, and `lint-staged`. Adjust the respective fields in `package.json` accordingly.

### Jest

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.

#### Setup Files

This is the folder structure we set up for you:

```txt
/example
  index.html
  index.tsx       # test your component here in a demo app
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
/src
  index.tsx       # EDIT THIS
/test
  blah.test.tsx   # EDIT THIS
/stories
  Thing.stories.tsx # EDIT THIS
/.storybook
  main.js
  preview.js
.gitignore
package.json
README.md         # EDIT THIS
tsconfig.json
```

#### React Testing Library

We do not set up `react-testing-library` for you yet, we welcome contributions and documentation on this.

### Rollup

TSDX uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) as a bundler and generates multiple rollup configs for various module formats and build settings. See [Optimizations](#optimizations) for details.

### TypeScript

`tsconfig.json` is set up to interpret `dom` and `esnext` types, as well as `react` for `jsx`. Adjust according to your needs.

## Continuous Integration

## Optimizations

Please see the main `tsdx` [optimizations docs](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#optimizations). In particular, know that you can take advantage of development-only optimizations:

```js
// ./types/index.d.ts
declare var __DEV__: boolean;

// inside your code...
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log("foo");
}
```

You can also choose to install and use [invariant](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#invariant) and [warning](https://github.com/palmerhq/tsdx#warning) functions.
